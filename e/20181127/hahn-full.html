                            <td><p>What could be more naturally dispiriting than a November — an election month — during our current historical moment?</p> <p>Political partisans and social activists have worked themselves into frenzy by now. Their advertisers are exploiting the panic to draw more donations, sounding alarms many times a day on social media and email. Ordinary people — good people — destroy friendships and family bonds in their righteous indignation.</p> <p>Such behavior is not confined to one political party, or one ideology, or a single issue, or a constellation of issues. It is, in fact, not even a phenomenon confined to our time — though social media have certainly acted as an accelerant to the craziness.</p> <p>If you detect these symptoms in yourself, please seek help immediately. Go to the sacraments. Make a good confession. Receive Holy Communion. Then repeat the process with the frequency prescribed by your confessor.</p> <p>I say this not only because it’s a month that begins with an election, but because it’s the month that draws to a close with the great Feast of Christ the King (Sunday, November 25, this year). This is the feast that keeps our focus where it belongs. It is the sure remedy for election mania, which is a species of idolatry. If our hope in politicians — whether Supreme Court justices or senators — is so ardent that it provokes us to the sin of wrath, well then we’ve got things out of order.</p> <p>“For the LORD is our judge, the LORD is our lawgiver, the LORD is our king; he will save us” (Isaiah 33:22). The Prophet gives us an infallible reason for confidence and peace. No storm should shake our inmost calm. We need not grow anxious about the success or failure of our candidates or nominees. We need not even worry much over the scandals plaguing the Church.</p> <p>We don’t place our trust in princes. The gates of hell will not prevail against the Church, which is ultimately the only kingdom that matters. We may witness injustice during our years on earth — and we should fight to right wrongs — but always in charity. Everyone we consider an enemy, an opponent, a rival, is a potential fellow citizen of the City of God.</p> <p>It’s the habit of Christians to pray to the Lord, “Thy kingdom come!” We should be eager for the kingdom’s fullness, which will be manifest at the end of time. But we should not forget that we already possess the fullness whenever we go to Mass. Christ will not possess more glory at the end of time than he already possesses right now.</p> <p>He comes to us even amidst our scandals. If we keep our focus, we see that the Church is already glorious, because it is both earthly and heavenly. It is already the communion of saints, many in heaven, but many too who are here on earth, unknown to us. God is bringing his plan to completion, in spite of the world’s injustices and scandals, in spite of your sins and mine.</p> <p>So let’s not look with hope to Washington. Our salvation won’t come from the White House or the Supreme Court, and certainly not from Congress. If we’ve been riding the political roller coaster — or even the roller coaster of ecclesiastical politics — then we should repent and take our place with the saints.</p> <p>This doesn’t mean we cease to fight for justice. It does mean that we cease to make idols of our human institutions.</p> <p>We can look ahead in hope. Even in the near term, good things are coming. On Black Friday (November 23), we’re going to make it easier and more affordable for you to do your Christmas shopping. We’ll offer special sales through our online store. And next month, with Advent, the Saint Paul Center will again be streaming video of “The Bible and the Virgin Mary” — free of charge!</p> <p>The Saint Paul Center thrives when all of us, you and I, are faithful and focused. I thank you for all you’ve done to help us manifest the kingdom, through your prayers, your contributions, and your encouraging words.</p></td>
