              <p>As of 3–31–19, the Morningstar category percentile rankings were as follows; Ave Maria Bond Fund (Allocation 15–30% Equity Category): 1 yr. (16), 3 yr. (78), 5 yr. (48) and 10 yr. (87), Ave Maria Growth Fund (Mid-Cap Growth Category): 1 yr. (16), 3 yr. (29), 5 yr. (17) and 10 yr. (31), Ave Maria Rising Dividend Fund (Large Blend Category): 1 yr. (29), 3 yr. (57), 5 yr. (74) and 10 yr. (53), Ave Maria Value Fund (Mid-Cap Blend Category): 1 yr. (66), 3 yr. (19), 5 yr. (92) and 10 yr. (87) and Ave Maria World Equity Fund (World Large Stock Category): 1 yr. (21), 3 yr. (50) and 5 yr. (69). The Morningstar Rating™ for funds, or “star rating”, is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product’s monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36–59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60–119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods. A 4- or 5-star rating does not necessarily imply that a fund has achieved positive results for the period.

              <p>Schwartz Investment Counsel, Inc., a registered investment adviser established in 1980, serves as investment adviser for Ave Maria Mutual Funds. The Adviser invests in securities only if they meet the Funds’ investment and religious requirements, and as such, the returns may be lower or higher than if the Adviser made decisions based solely on investment considerations. The Funds’ method of security selection may or may not be successful and the Funds may underperform or outperform the stock market as a whole. All mutual funds are subject to market risk, including possible loss of principal. The Funds’ investments in small and mid-capitalization companies could experience greater volatility than investments in large capitalization companies. AVEWX invests in foreign securities and securities issued by U.S. entities with substantial foreign operations. Investments in these securities can involve additional risks relating to political, economic or regulatory conditions in foreign countries. These risks include less stringent investor protection and disclosure standards of some foreign markets; fluctuations in foreign currencies; and withholding or other taxes.
